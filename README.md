An organization administers other contracts. For an individual contract or a system of contracts, an organization enables limiting execution of certain functions to the organization or other accounts it authorizes (e.g., "workers").

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Project requires [node] and [npm] to be installed.

### Cloning

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenST/organization-contracts.git
```

### Installing

Install npm packages:

```bash
cd organization-contracts
npm install
```
## Usage

The contracts and interfaces in this repository are primarily intended for use in other OpenST projects. Please see [Related Work].

### Compiling the contracts

The following npm script compiles updated contracts since the last compile using [truffle]:

```bash
npm run compile
```

To compile all contracts, including the ones that haven't changed:

```bash
npm run compile-all
```

### Testing the contracts

We use the [ganache] blockchain for development. Before running the tests, start `ganache`:

```bash
npm run ganache-cli
```

Test the contracts using [truffle]:

```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

[ESLint] is used to lint js files.

To lint all js files within the `./test` and `./tool` directories, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Related Work

OpenST uses organization contracts and interfaces in [mosaic-contracts], [brandedtoken-contracts], and [openst-contracts] to scale, create, and define blockchain token economies.
